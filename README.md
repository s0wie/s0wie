# Hi there, I'm Susanne ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year web developer student at [YRGO](https://github.com/yrgo), who also studied at [IT-hÃ¶gskolan](https://www.linkedin.com/school/it-hogskolan/) during my first year of studies. I love it. I enjoy learning new things every day, problem-solving and to contribute to beautiful user interfaces. I think it's fun to explore new concepts and ideas, and hopefully, I'll get to work with just that. 

If you want to reach me
